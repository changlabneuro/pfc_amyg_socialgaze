* `Social_gaze_monitoring_model.m`: store data and run the social gaze monitoring model using stepwise GLM
* `Single_neuron_PSTH.m`: plot single-neuron PSTHs of distance modulation (self-distance and other-distance)
* `Proportion_better_sig_neurons.m`: calculate the proportion of the better significant term or any significant term for each region
* `Distribution_coef.m`: get the coefficient of significant self-distance and other-distance term for each cell
* `Correlation_m1dis_m2dis.m`: calculate the correlation between self-distance and other-distance for each day and across days
* `R2_null.m`: calculate R2 of model fit for each cell and create a null distribution for each cell by shuffling the set of spike counts, self-distance, and other-distance
